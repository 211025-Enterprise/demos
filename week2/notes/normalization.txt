Normal Forms
1NF
2NF
3NF - for p0
3.5NF (BCNF)
4NF
5NF
6NF - just a theory


1NF
- Each Cell Should Contain a Single Value
- Each Record Needs to Be Unique

2NF
- Must Be In 1NF
- Single column primary key that is not functionally dependant on any subset of candidate key

3NF
- Must Be In 2NF
- Has no Transitive Functional Dependencies - 
A transitive functional dependency is when changing a non-key column, 
might cause any of the other non-key columns to change

3.5NF or Boyce-Codd Normal Form
- Must be in 3NF
- A record must only have a single column primary candidate key. should have no other candidate keys

4NF
- Must be in 3.5NF
- If no database table instance contains two or more, independent and multivalued data describing 
the relevant entity, then it is in 4NF.

5NF
- Must be in 4NF
- Must not be able to break the table down any farther.
