4 Pillars of OOP

Polymorphism - many form
Inheritance - being able to inherit or share behaviors and traits
Encapsulation - data hiding, portability
Abstraction - a way of simplifying complex implementations

Class - blueprint to create an instance (object) - encapsulation
Object - runtime entites that have a set of behaviors and properties - polymorphism
